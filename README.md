##### Get Recorder Instance and related `methods`
Add attribute `onRef={ref => (this.child = ref)}` to get access to player instance and related methods.

```javascript
    <ZiggeoRecorder
        apiKey={apiToken}
        onRef={ref => (this.child = ref)}
    />

```javascript
    this.child.get(args);
    this.child.play();
    this.child.record();
    this.child.upload();
    this.child.rerecord();
    this.child.stop();
    this.child.hidePopup();
    this.child.reset();
```
Also you can get player instance:
```
    let recorderInstance = this.child.recorderInstance();
    // you can call above functions also example: playerInstance.play();
    let properties = this.playerInstance.get('propertyName');
```

## Component Options:
```javascript
    preventReRenderOnUpdate={boolean} // default is true
```

## Notes:
By default Components prevent re-render UI with option `preventReRenderOnUpdate`, in case if you want to re-render it, you have set it to true.
```javascript
    <ZiggeoRecorder
        preventReRenderOnUpdate={false}
    />
```
Note that it can cause issue during calling `setState` in `componentDidMount` method when call right after initialization.
