## Ziggeo's React component 

This branch "Latest Branch" is upgraded to use Ziggeo's latest JS SDK version. The goal is to offer easier way for customers that want to use the latest features within their React projects.

### Should I use it?

If you know why you want to use the latest revision of our JS SDK and why this is important for you, please go ahead. All of our revisions go through different testing stages before we publish them to make sure that they are as bug free as possible. That said, we name some tags as "stable" and use that in React by default because next to our tests, a large number of people had tested them out and is using them as well.

Other than having the latest features, documentation found on our master branch is still valid.

All parameters, methods and events that we support through use of this branch can be found on the following pages:

https://ziggeo.com/docs/sdks/javascript/browser-integration/parameters/

https://ziggeo.com/docs/sdks/javascript/browser-interaction/methods/

https://ziggeo.com/docs/sdks/javascript/browser-interaction/events/

### Requirements

If you download this branch most of the things are done. You will still need to run `npm` or `yarn` commands as explained here: https://github.com/Ziggeo/react-ziggeo#upgrade-ziggeo-sdk in order to build your project.
